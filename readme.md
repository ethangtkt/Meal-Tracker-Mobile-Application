# üçΩ Meal Tracker Mobile Application
## üéì About The Class
#### CSE382 - Mobile Application Development
This course is rarely offered at Miami University so when I found out they were delivering it in the Summer of 2021, I immediately signed up for it. The class dove straight into topics as it was a pretty intense course being only six weeks long. We had 5 projects, a final project, ‚Äòexam-like weekly quizzes, and assignments that would go along with our lecture videos. The class was really enjoyable due to the organization of it.

## üåÆ About The Program
I created this program as my final project for this class. I was between a couple of ideas since we were given the freedom to choose but I decided to use a meal tracker. I picked this idea for the sole reason of wanting to experiment with APIs. I thought the idea of a meal tracker gave me a lot of opportunities to find different APIs about food online. I ended up paying to use two different APIs from the same website, called [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). I used one to [search up menu items](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Menu-Items) and based on the results of the other API, I would get the nutrition facts using [another API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Menu-Item-Information). The program taught me a lot about this side of computer science. Along with the APIs, there were also some other features within the application. Other requirements of the project were the use of web services, user preferences, MVVM architecture, local databases, being multipage, listviews, and images. The program was 22% of my final grade and I got a 94% on it with some points being deducted due to the midpoint demonstration.

## ü•û Note
If you are going to download this and try to run this program in Visual Studio, there is a couple of things you might have to do to get it to run for an android simulation and UWP. First, you have to download the workload that uses Xamarin for cross-platform mobile application development. You can do this by going to <br>

</p>
<br>

This should allow you to run it within UWP and potentially an android simulation. If you are still having problems with running the android simulation, check out 
[this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/hardware-acceleration?tabs=vswin&pivots=windows) and it will most likely fix the problem. If it doesn‚Äôt fix it, you can honestly email me and I can help you out and most likely update this document with more solutions.

## üçï The *Tasty* Features
### ü•ó Application Programing Interfaces (APIs)

**APIs Used:**
- [Search Up Menu Item](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Menu-Items)
- [Get Specific Item Information](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Menu-Item-Information)

The best part about this program without a doubt. I found this really neat API to use online revolving all-around food. The two in particular that I used were dependent on one another within my program. What I mean by this is that you couldn‚Äôt query the second API without the results from the first API. It made testing a little bit more tedious and difficult but it worked out great in the end. The first API takes a series of food/meal keywords and gets a list of results that match the closest to the keywords. So if I searched up ‚ÄúTaco Bell‚Äù it would bring back the top ten menu items from Taco Bell.

</p>

<br>

Since this API only gave us the menu item, image, name, and restaurant, I had to take the food ID and query a second API and query that using the food from the first. A little meta and complicated at the start but very elegant when you draw it out on paper! The second API would bring back all of the nutrition facts that are shown in the GUI. After this, we now have all of the information that is needed to be added to our local database/the user‚Äôs food diary.

</p>

<br>

After this, we now have all of the information that is needed to be added to our local database/the user‚Äôs food diary. As you can see the user can choose what meal they want to add it to as well as the date. That would get transferred to the Diary page and updated as needed.

### üçî Favorite Food User Preferences
User preferences are a simple way to store values locally on a user‚Äôs device. It is not meant for large or important data for the application, just smaller stuff. For the sake of my project, I have the calorie goal for the user set as a preference. If the application was deleted off of the device, the preference would be reset.

### üå≠ Model-View View-Model (MVVM) Architecture

<p align="center">
View  ‚Üî  Controller  ‚Üî  Model
</p>

A complex concept to learn within mobile applications. You have three different components within this concept that talk to each other. Our application uses a slider on the summary page to update the calories on the screen. Instead of making an on update function which we could have easily done, the slider is directly tied to everything that needs to be updated on-screen. It makes the phone use less power since it is more efficient and is a more streamlined process.

<br><br>
### ü•™ Databases
For this application, I used Visual Studio‚Äôs NuGet package search feature to find a package called SQLite-net-PCL. This simulates any ordinary database that you would see in an application. Unline preferences, this is where we can store larger amounts of data within our application. For this application, we used it to store the food entities in a giant schema that the application referenced when loading the Diary page. All of the data was saved locally to the device. The schema‚Äôs columns were designed as followed:


| id | Date | Meal | Name | Calories | Fat | Protein | Carbs
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
| PRIMARY KEY int | DateTime | string | string | double | double | double | double 

 
<br><br>
### üçü Multipage Application
Pretty self-explanatory, the idea that your application has navigation between multiple pages. My application is tabbed. You can navigate between multiple pages by using the buttons located at the top or bottom of your screen. The example below demonstrates only two tabs, Diary and Track.

<br>

</p>

<br>

Another navigation feature used is stacked navigation. Furthermore, when you opt to search for a meal rather than track it manually, a page will push on top of the track page/on top of the stack. You cannot return to the original tabbed navigation until all of the stack is popped. 

<br><br>
### üåØ List Views
List views are used throughout the program. It is used to show the diary contents including all of the macronutrients and the food name. It is also for the search results. The list for the results creates a list of buttons for the user to click on and get the further macros for the food.
