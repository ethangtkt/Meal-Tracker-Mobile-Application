# 🍔 Meal Tracker Mobile Application
## 🎓 About The Class
#### CSE382 - Mobile Application Development
This course is rarely offered at Miami University so when I found out they were delivering it in the Summer of 2021, I immediately signed up for it. The class dove straight into topics as it was a pretty intense course being only six weeks long. We had 5 projects, a final project, ‘exam-like weekly quizzes, and assignments that would go along with our lecture videos. The class was really enjoyable due to the organization of it.

## ℹ About The Program
I created this program as my final project for this class. I was between a couple of ideas since we were given the freedom to choose but I decided to use a meal tracker. I picked this idea for the sole reason of wanting to experiment with APIs. I thought the idea of a meal tracker gave me a lot of oppertunities to find different APIs about food online. I ended up paying to use two different APIs from the same website, called [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). I used one to [search up menu items](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Menu-Items) and based on the results of the other API, I would get the nutrition facts using [another API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Menu-Item-Information). The program taught me a lot about this side of computer science. Along with the APIs, there were also some other features within the application. Other requirements of the project were the use of webservices, user preferences, MVVM architecture, local databases, being multipage, listviews, and images. The program was 22% of my final grade and I got a 94% on it with some points being deducted due to the midpoint demonstration.
