# 🍔 Meal Tracker Mobile Application
## 🎓 About The Class

## ℹ About The Program
I created this program as my final project for this class. I was between a couple ideas since we were given the freedom to choose but I decided to use a meal tracker. I picked this idea for the sole reason of wanting to experiment with APIs. I thought the idea of a meal tracker gave me a lot of oppertunities to find different APIs about food online. I ended up paying to use two different APIs from the same website, called [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). I used one to [search up menu items](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Menu-Items) and based on the results of the other API, I would get the nutrition facts using [another API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Menu-Item-Information). The program taught me a lot about this side of computer science. Along with the APIs, there was also some other features within the application. Other requirements of the project was the use of webservices, user preferences, MVVM architecture, local databases, being multipage, listviews, and images. The program was 22% of my final grade and I got a 94% on it with some points being deducted due to the midpoint demonstration.
